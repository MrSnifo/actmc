**Build intelligent Minecraft bots without protocol headaches.**

actmc eliminates the complexity of Minecraft protocol handling, letting you focus on creating smart bots for offline servers. Built for Python developers who want clean, performant automation.

## Why actmc?

**Async-first design** - Built with Python's async/await from the ground up. Non-blocking operations that play nicely with your existing async stack.

**Protocol mastery** - Handles Minecraft protocol communication with robust error recovery and network resilience.

**Performance optimized** - Lightweight, memory-efficient architecture with blazing-fast event processing.

**Developer experience** - Intuitive API with full type hints, comprehensive documentation, and excellent IDE support.

## Architecture

actmc uses event-driven architecture where your bot responds to server events naturally. We handle the protocol complexity - you handle the intelligence.
