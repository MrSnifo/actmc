## Why actmc?

Building Minecraft bots shouldn't require wrestling with protocol internals. **actmc** strips away the complexity, letting you focus on what matters—creating intelligent bots for offline servers.

**Proper async support** - Built with Python's async/await from the ground up. Non-blocking operations that work well with other async libraries.

**Protocol handling** - Manages Minecraft protocol communication with robust error handling for network issues.

**Performance focused** - Lightweight and memory efficient with fast event processing.

**Developer friendly** - Clean, intuitive API design with type hints for better IDE support.

## Architecture

**actmc** follows an event-driven architecture where your bot responds to server events naturally. The library handles all the low-level protocol complexity while exposing a simple, modern Python API.

Sure! Here’s the updated version with **Concepts first**, and **"Core"** removed:
